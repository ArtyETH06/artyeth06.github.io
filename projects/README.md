## DeFi Lottery 

DeFi Lottery was a projec I developped with a friend while we were in our first year of HighSchool.
The project was to create an alternative to the traditionnal lottery by creating one on the Web3, always a winner, secured by a smart contract I developped in `Solidity`.
The reason why the project never came out was because we havent got enough people to participate, even though everything else was ready.

You can find all the information on this very (very) old gitbook => https://decentralized-lottery.gitbook.io/copy-of-defi-lottery/
