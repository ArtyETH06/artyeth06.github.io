## Arty Hosting Service

Arty Hosting Service is a service I developped by myself, allowing users fron star Atlas who uses the SLY Assistant tool to get their bot running 24/7 on the "cloud" with no interruptions, and therefore maximizing profits.

## Web3 projects

I have been in the Web3 ecosystem for approximately 6 years from now, and throuhgh different projects, I had acquired a lot of experience in this field, and developped multiple (private) projects that are including:

## Duck Adventures

Made a game with Unity, and C#, dont ever talk to me be about Ducks again


## DeFi Lottery 

DeFi Lottery was a project I developped with a friend while we were in our first year of Highschool.
The project was to create an alternative to the traditionnal lottery by creating one on the Web3, always a winner, secured by a smart contract I developped in `Solidity`.
The reason why the project never came out was because we havent got enough people to participate, even though everything else was ready.

You can find all the information on [this very (very) old gitbook](https://decentralized-lottery.gitbook.io/copy-of-defi-lottery/)
