# Certifications

## CRTP

The `CRTP` (**C**ertified **R**ed **T**eam **P**rofessional), is the latest certification I passed, annnnd well...I struggled for this one to be honest, had to re-watch the course material multiple time (In hindsight, It was because I wasnt focused enough when viewing the videos...)

It contains advanced Active Direcory content, learned a LOOOOT of things that allowed me to get a better understanding of AD, and the most important part, about all the possible vulnerable stuff we can find.

I would recommend to have a basic understanding on AD and common attacks.

The 24h exam is really challenging, but worth it.

## PWPA

The `PWPA` (**P**ractical **W**eb **P**entest **A**ssociate) is an entry-level certification to *"discover"* the bug bounty world. 

Before starting the course and taking the exam I already had some experience with web pentest, but wanted to reinforce my skills.

Alex is a really good instructor, and very good hands-on exam, really loved it.

This is for beginners who wants to enter the bug bounty world, loved it 10/10.

## PJPT

The `PJPT` (**P**ractical **J**unior **P**enetration **T**ester) was the first ever certification I passed in the cybersecurity field, It was also my first introduction to AD (**A**ctive **D**irectory).

Through the courses from *TCM Security*, I learned a lot of things regarding AD and really enjoyed the exam.

I would recommend this certification to anyone willing to make their first step in AD. You can find more inormaion [here](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/)
