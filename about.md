# About Me

In 2010 to 2021, I'm just a people person who plays video games around 16 hours every day. During that time period, I also self-taught video game level design, reading programming codes(Not writing codes). In the mid 2021, I started to plan my future, like what career path should I take.

In around mid January 2022, I was randomly watching Youtube videos, and suddenly I saw [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck)'s video talking about [password cracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_oqTZJqCo). By watching his video, it catches my eye balls, I was fascinated in ethical hacking and try to follow his tutorials to build a virtual environment, installing Kali Linux, cracking password with `HashCat`. And this is how my ethical hacking journey starts!

Started from 12nd March 2022, I started to learn ethical hacking much deeper, and registered a [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/siunam) account and learning all the fundamentals from scratch, and constantly writing CTF writeups, take part in CTF competitions and so on.
